The think tank says victims are often treated as criminals and there is little understanding of how widespread the problem is. The government rejects much of the criticism and says the current Home Office-led approach is working. UK trafficking victim Mark Ovenden, and Professor Nicola Phillips from the University of Sheffield, said that there needed to be greater awareness of the problem in the UK. Mark, who has since made a new life, described his experience of working long hours for little or no pay, as ''a form of mental imprisonment.'' 10 Mar 2013 Share this with Facebook Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share this with Email Share this with Facebook Share this with WhatsApp Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share Share this with These are external links and will open in a new window Email Share this with Email Facebook Share this with Facebook Messenger Share this with Messenger Messenger Share this with Messenger Twitter Share this with Twitter Pinterest Share this with Pinterest WhatsApp Share this with WhatsApp LinkedIn Share this with LinkedIn Copy this link https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-21732500/uk-trafficking-victim-it-is-a-form-of-mental-imprisonment Read more about sharing.

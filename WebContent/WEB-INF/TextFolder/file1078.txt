Dangling 285ft (87m) above the rush-hour traffic and trains, the 15-minute show amazed onlookers, reminding New Yorkers of Philippe Petit's unauthorised tightrope walk between the twin towers of the World Trade Center in 1974. Once back on the ground, however, the "aerialist" - a performer who is part acrobat, part dancer - was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment. The charges were later reduced to trespassing on a public bridge. Sharpe, who joined the circus at 16 and is now aged 25, talked to the BBC about the illegal stunt and why she was prepared to risk her life to feel the sensation of flying. Produced by Anna Bressanin; camera by Ilya Shnitser Bridge footage by Ronenv.com; facilities courtesy of Julio Mora and OM Factory. 03 Dec 2012 Share this with Facebook Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share this with Email Share this with Facebook Share this with WhatsApp Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share Share this with These are external links and will open in a new window Email Share this with Email Facebook Share this with Facebook Messenger Share this with Messenger Messenger Share this with Messenger Twitter Share this with Twitter Pinterest Share this with Pinterest WhatsApp Share this with WhatsApp LinkedIn Share this with LinkedIn Copy this link https://www.bbc.com/news/av/magazine-20576467/seanna-sharpe-on-the-art-of-the-death-defying-stunt Read more about sharing.

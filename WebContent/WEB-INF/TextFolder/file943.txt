But this low-tech imagery in a digital age still has the power to capture the the seminal moments of justice in action. Almost 100 court sketches have been donated to the Library of Congress in Washington where they will eventually form part of an exhibition. Artists have captured iconic moments ranging from Michael Jackson's acquittal to the moment murderer Charles Manson lunged for his judge. Jane O'Brien was given a preview. Filmed by Ron Skeans. Edited by Olivia Lace-Evans. 09 Apr 2016 Share this with Facebook Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share this with Email Share this with Facebook Share this with WhatsApp Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share Share this with These are external links and will open in a new window Email Share this with Email Facebook Share this with Facebook Messenger Share this with Messenger Messenger Share this with Messenger Twitter Share this with Twitter Pinterest Share this with Pinterest WhatsApp Share this with WhatsApp LinkedIn Share this with LinkedIn Copy this link https://www.bbc.com/news/av/36001664/the-art-of-the-court-trial Read more about sharing.

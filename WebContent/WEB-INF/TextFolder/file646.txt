That's one of the questions being debated on social media after an image was posted showing men occupying ladies-only seats on the Delhi metro. Seats and carriages are reserved for women on many buses and trains across India to protect women from sexual harassment. In Delhi the rape and murder of a student on a bus in December 2012 led to huge protests and new anti-rape laws. #BBCtrending reports on what has become an extremely contentious issue in a country grappling with gender equality. Produced by Anne-Marie Tomchak and Dean Arnett Do you use transport in Delhi?

His career as a conductor, however, has endured both high notes and low. Braunstein's professional track was derailed by bipolar disorder. He says his colleagues in the music business seemed little to understand his condition and that he suffered discrimination as a result. Now he hopes to use his talent to help others. He conducts the ME2 orchestra in Vermont where amateur musicians coping with mental illness come together with those supporting their cause to create music without worrying about the stigma. Produced by the BBC's Franz Strasser and David Botti. 07 Jan 2013 Share this with Facebook Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share this with Email Share this with Facebook Share this with WhatsApp Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share Share this with These are external links and will open in a new window Email Share this with Email Facebook Share this with Facebook Messenger Share this with Messenger Messenger Share this with Messenger Twitter Share this with Twitter Pinterest Share this with Pinterest WhatsApp Share this with WhatsApp LinkedIn Share this with LinkedIn Copy this link https://www.bbc.com/news/av/magazine-20732070/conductor-with-bipolar-disorder-on-music-and-mental-illness Read more about sharing.

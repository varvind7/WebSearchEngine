But more than half of all undocumented residents live in so-called "sanctuary cities" - local jurisdictions that have vowed not to co-operate with federal immigration policies that seek to deport non-violent criminals. Trump has called for a federal funding cut for those municipalities that refuse to hand over their undocumented residents and said he will focus on deporting criminals first. The BBC went to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where Mayor Javier Gonzales says he will continue to provide a safe haven for peaceful immigrants. Produced by the BBC's Franz Strasser. 22 Dec 2016 Share this with Facebook Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share this with Email Share this with Facebook Share this with WhatsApp Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share Share this with These are external links and will open in a new window Email Share this with Email Facebook Share this with Facebook Messenger Share this with Messenger Messenger Share this with Messenger Twitter Share this with Twitter Pinterest Share this with Pinterest WhatsApp Share this with WhatsApp LinkedIn Share this with LinkedIn Copy this link https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-38370634/sanctuary-cities-under-threat-by-donald-trump Read more about sharing.

Under pressure from Hispanic politicians, Mr Obama last week announced a review of his administration's deportation policy, promising to enforce immigration laws "more humanely". Many of those sent back to Mexico have to walk through a door in the fence separating California and the Mexican town of Tijuana. Some were caught trying to enter the US illegally, others had lived in the US - without papers - for years. Officially they are being sent "home", but often deportation means being separated from families still in the US and starting a new life from scratch. The BBC's Valeria Perasso reports from both sides of the border on what happens to deportees once they pass through this door.

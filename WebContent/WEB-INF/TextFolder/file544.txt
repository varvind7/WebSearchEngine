India's Supreme Court on Wednesday reinstated a ban on same-sex partnerships after a four-year period of decriminalisation. The court ruled that only India's parliament could change Section 377, which describes a same-sex relationship as an "unnatural offence" that is punishable by a 10-year jail term. Hashtags about the ruling trended on Twitter, including: #sec377 #scrap377 and #LGBT. In Australia, legislation allowing gay marriage in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) was overturned. Meanwhile in Russia, gay rights groups are calling for increased pressure on the International Olympic Committee ahead of next year's Winter Olympic Games in Sochi. #BBCtrending's Anne-Marie Tomchak investigates the social media tactics being used by LGBT supporters.

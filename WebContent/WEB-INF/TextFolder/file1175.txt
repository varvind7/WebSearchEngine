His 2014 debut album Brave Confusion saw him being crowned newcomer of the year at the South African Music Awards, and he is now working on a new project with popular South African DJ Black Coffee. He has also come out as gay, something which he has addressed in his music. The BBC's Taurai Maduna caught up with him in Johannesburg.

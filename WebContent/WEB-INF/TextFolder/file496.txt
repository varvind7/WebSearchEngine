It is a new approach for the company which has struggled to attract customers to its own operating system, BB10. BlackBerry said its new device, Priv, was designed to offer customers improved security over rival Android handsets. "Coming with a device that tries to address security on Android is a good idea, but may have been better three years ago," said Francisco Jeronimo, research director for industry analysts IDC. "It will be difficult to regain clients who have already moved to other handsets, and it's quite an expensive device." The BBC's Rory Cellan-Jones went hands-on with the Priv and asked the company if it was enough to win back market share. 06 Nov 2015 Share this with Facebook Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share this with Email Share this with Facebook Share this with WhatsApp Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share Share this with These are external links and will open in a new window Email Share this with Email Facebook Share this with Facebook Messenger Share this with Messenger Messenger Share this with Messenger Twitter Share this with Twitter Pinterest Share this with Pinterest WhatsApp Share this with WhatsApp LinkedIn Share this with LinkedIn Copy this link https://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-34720963/blackberry-launches-priv-smartphone-running-android Read more about sharing.

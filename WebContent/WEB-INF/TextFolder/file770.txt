The Canadian company is experiencing shrinking demand for its handsets. It shipped fewer than 8 million phones last year - less than a sixth of the number it did three years before. John Chen unveiled the Blackberry Leap - a touchscreen model without a physical keyboard - at Barcelona's Mobile World Congress trade show this week, and said a further three designs would be launched before the end of 2015. He has also made more of the company's apps and services available to rival platforms, for which Blackberry will charge. The BBC's Rory Cellan-Jones asked Mr Chen whether Blackberry would be better off giving up making hardware to focus on software. 04 Mar 2015 Share this with Facebook Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share this with Email Share this with Facebook Share this with WhatsApp Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share Share this with These are external links and will open in a new window Email Share this with Email Facebook Share this with Facebook Messenger Share this with Messenger Messenger Share this with Messenger Twitter Share this with Twitter Pinterest Share this with Pinterest WhatsApp Share this with WhatsApp LinkedIn Share this with LinkedIn Copy this link https://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-31718532/blackberry-chief-wants-to-persevere-with-smartphones Read more about sharing.

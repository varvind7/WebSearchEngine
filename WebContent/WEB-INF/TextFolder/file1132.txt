They were also charged with criminal conspiracy, police said, adding that three people had been arrested so far. The government has pledged to set up a fast-track court to prosecute the crime, which took place earlier this week in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Alleged police inaction sparked outrage in the teenagers' village. The father of one victim told the BBC he was ridiculed by police when he sought help in finding his missing daughter.

The options include a breathalyser, a multi-coloured flashlight, an SD card reader and an air quality sensor. The Nexpaq case itself will cost $99 (£68) and its modules will range in price from $20 to $45. Smartphones that come with the built-in ability to accept modules are already on sale and in development - but the advantage of this product is that it can be used with existing iPhones and Galaxy S6 handsets.

Melissa Plancarte, who is also a singer, posed in an outfit covered in the insignia of her father's gang, The Knights Templar. Her father Enrique is one of seven leaders of the group, who control many areas of embattled western state of Michoacan. The images caused anger because "vigilante" groups are fighting the cartels on the ground, and they are also now waging a social media campaign against cartel leaders and their families. Although Mexico has a fascination with the culture associated with drug trafficking, the pictures of the "cartel kids" have not gone down well.

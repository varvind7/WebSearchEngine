Many have lost parents in the countries they have left or lost families on the journey to Europe. Very few have a support network and most have psychological issues due to their experiences, such as war or trafficking. One centre, run by the NGO Praksis, aims to rehabilitate them into Greek life and where possible, to seek out their families in order to reunite them. Sociologist Sissy Levanti described the challenges faced by the children in her care.

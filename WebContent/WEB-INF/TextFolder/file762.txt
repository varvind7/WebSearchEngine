The internal components of the Fairphone 2 are split into modules which can be replaced with minimal tools or expertise. The company behind the phone hopes this will encourage owners to keep their phones for longer, rather than regularly changing to new devices. Fairphone say they aim to create a more ethical device with an emphasis on reparability and sourcing key minerals used in the phone's construction from conflict-free areas.

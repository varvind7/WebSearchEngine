Muhiyidin Moye, the Black Lives Matter activist who lunged for the banner on Wednesday, was immediately arrested by police on suspicion of disorderly conduct. The flag-bearer belonged to a pro-racial segregation group that was protesting near a college campus against a speech by another activist who previously tore down a Confederate flag from the South Carolina statehouse. That earlier incident followed a racially motivated shooting at a black church in 2015, after which the southern state decided to no longer fly the flag. 23 Feb 2017 Share this with Facebook Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share this with Email Share this with Facebook Share this with WhatsApp Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share Share this with These are external links and will open in a new window Email Share this with Email Facebook Share this with Facebook Messenger Share this with Messenger Messenger Share this with Messenger Twitter Share this with Twitter Pinterest Share this with Pinterest WhatsApp Share this with WhatsApp LinkedIn Share this with LinkedIn Copy this link https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-39059984/airborne-black-lives-matter-protester-grabs-confederate-flag Read more about sharing.

Nearly half the population goes to the toilet in the open, and the prime minister has vowed to end the practice. But even if toilets are available, women must pay to use them whereas men can urinate for free. As part of the BBC's 100 Women season, on United Nations World Toilet Day, we spend a day with Mumtaz Shaikh, who is leading a 'right to pee' movement in Mumbai. 19 Nov 2015 Share this with Facebook Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share this with Email Share this with Facebook Share this with WhatsApp Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share Share this with These are external links and will open in a new window Email Share this with Email Facebook Share this with Facebook Messenger Share this with Messenger Messenger Share this with Messenger Twitter Share this with Twitter Pinterest Share this with Pinterest WhatsApp Share this with WhatsApp LinkedIn Share this with LinkedIn Copy this link https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-34861876/bbc-100-women-2015-india-s-right-to-pee-movement Read more about sharing.

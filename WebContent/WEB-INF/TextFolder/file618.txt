"You have a power to stop all deportations," the man said. Several people in the crowd began chanting "stop deportations" along with Mr Obama's election slogan, "Yes we can." Mr Obama told his security detail to leave the protester and the heckler alone before saying to them: "The easy way out is to try to yell and pretend like I can do something by violating our laws. "If in fact I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, I would do so." In 2012, Mr Obama put a halt to deportations of young people who came to the US as children. A sweeping immigration reform bill was passed in June by the US Senate, but the House of Representatives has said it would rather take up immigration issues through a number of legislative actions. 26 Nov 2013 Share this with Facebook Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share this with Email Share this with Facebook Share this with WhatsApp Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share Share this with These are external links and will open in a new window Email Share this with Email Facebook Share this with Facebook Messenger Share this with Messenger Messenger Share this with Messenger Twitter Share this with Twitter Pinterest Share this with Pinterest WhatsApp Share this with WhatsApp LinkedIn Share this with LinkedIn Copy this link https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-25098849/obama-heckled-at-immigration-speech-on-ending-deportations Read more about sharing.

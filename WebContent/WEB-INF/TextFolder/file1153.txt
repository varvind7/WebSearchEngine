She has been on national TV for more than a decade and her current show La Justa is one of the most famous and influential women in the country. She is a fierce advocate of women's rights in the country. Domestic violence is a deep-rooted problem for Bolivia, a country that sees the highest levels of violence against women in South America, according to a 2013 Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) study. She is also a supporter of indigenous and LGBT issues in her country and a prominent "cholita" - indigenous women notable for their distinctive dress. The "cholas" are indigenous Aymara and Quechua women who can be easily identified by their distinctive, elegant outfits. For decades they suffered discrimination, but they can now be seen studying at university, working in government ministries, banks and lawyers' offices, and anchoring TV and radio programmes. The BBC's 100 Women season runs online, on BBC World News TV and on BBC World Service radio from 27-29 October. Join the conversation on Facebook and Twitter, using the hashtag #100Women. 26 Oct 2014 Share this with Facebook Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share this with Email Share this with Facebook Share this with WhatsApp Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share Share this with These are external links and will open in a new window Email Share this with Email Facebook Share this with Facebook Messenger Share this with Messenger Messenger Share this with Messenger Twitter Share this with Twitter Pinterest Share this with Pinterest WhatsApp Share this with WhatsApp LinkedIn Share this with LinkedIn Copy this link https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-latin-america-29758798/100-women-bolivia-cholita-chef-justa-canaviri-on-abuse Read more about sharing.

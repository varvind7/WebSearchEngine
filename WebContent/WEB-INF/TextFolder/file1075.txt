The child of Siberian Komi nomads, she became a Soviet army officer and worked as a journalist for Pravda. Today she is a polar explorer and an ice artist and has devoted her life to the wellbeing of the "northern nation" of Arctic denizens. Morrell, 51, still undertakes hard-core expeditions and spends only about one month a year in the New York City apartment she shares with her American husband. Last June, she navigated the Greenlandic seas with three fellow explorers in a small open boat the size of a sofa. In hard weather conditions when it was impossible to dock, the group would spend days on end at sea. "The secret is to accept and try to adapt," she says.

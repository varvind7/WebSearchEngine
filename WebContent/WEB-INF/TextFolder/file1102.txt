The prime minister's official spokesman said it was wrong for the US president to retweet anti-Muslim videos posted by the far-right organisation Britain First. Home Secretary Amber Rudd told the House of Commons she agreed with Theresa May, but confirmed that the state visit invitation had been made and accepted, although the dates had not yet been set. The Rhondda MP said the visit should be called off, saying Mr Trump's actions were no accident, but "deliberate and intentional". 30 Nov 2017 Share this with Facebook Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share this with Email Share this with Facebook Share this with WhatsApp Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share Share this with These are external links and will open in a new window Email Share this with Email Facebook Share this with Facebook Messenger Share this with Messenger Messenger Share this with Messenger Twitter Share this with Twitter Pinterest Share this with Pinterest WhatsApp Share this with WhatsApp LinkedIn Share this with LinkedIn Copy this link https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-wales-politics-42182907/donald-trump-far-right-retweets-deliberate-and-intentional Read more about sharing.

A passer-by named Paul told her interviewee Ruqaiya Haris: "There's no Sharia law here". Describing Islam as an ideology, not a religion, he said separately that he believed an elite were using the Muslim faith "to take over the world". It comes as data, collated by think tank Demos, suggests almost 7,000 "Islamophobic" tweets were sent, in English, every day in July worldwide. The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.

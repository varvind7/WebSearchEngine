Imitone works by using a microphone as a MIDI input. An algorithm then identifies the pitch and assigns a note to the user's voice. When used alongside music software the note can be played out as any digital instrument with no latency, meaning the user can get almost instantaneous feedback. The inventor of imitone, Evan Balster, said the software would allow people with little music experience to be creative without the need to play instruments. Click's LJ Rich invited musicians from different genres to try out the new software. Watch more clips on the Click website. If you are in the UK you can watch the whole programme on BBC iPlayer. 25 Apr 2014 Share this with Facebook Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share this with Email Share this with Facebook Share this with WhatsApp Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share Share this with These are external links and will open in a new window Email Share this with Email Facebook Share this with Facebook Messenger Share this with Messenger Messenger Share this with Messenger Twitter Share this with Twitter Pinterest Share this with Pinterest WhatsApp Share this with WhatsApp LinkedIn Share this with LinkedIn Copy this link https://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-27124962/the-software-turning-your-voice-into-any-instrument Read more about sharing.

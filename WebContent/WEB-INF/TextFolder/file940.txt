But one of America's greatest legal scholars sees deeper themes hidden among the lightsaber showdowns and galactic firefights. In his new book, The World According to Star Wars, Harvard Law School's Cass Sunstein explores the many possible meanings of the storylines, which range from Christianity and Feminism, to technology and Thomas Jefferson. He joined the World News America programme to discuss it all with the BBC's Jane O'Brien. 02 Jun 2016 Share this with Facebook Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share this with Email Share this with Facebook Share this with WhatsApp Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share Share this with These are external links and will open in a new window Email Share this with Email Facebook Share this with Facebook Messenger Share this with Messenger Messenger Share this with Messenger Twitter Share this with Twitter Pinterest Share this with Pinterest WhatsApp Share this with WhatsApp LinkedIn Share this with LinkedIn Copy this link https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-36431529/uncovering-the-parallels-between-star-wars-and-everyday-life Read more about sharing.

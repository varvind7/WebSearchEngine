It’s the first time warplanes have crossed the de-facto border dividing the disputed territory of Kashmir - claimed by both India and Pakistan - in more than 40 years. India’s foreign secretary called the strikes a "non-military pre-emptive action," saying the strikes targeted a training camp for the Jaish-e-Mohammad group in Balakot, north-east Pakistan. Pakistan has said it will respond to the strikes, and dismissed India’s claims that the strikes killed “a very large number” of fighters. In February, the Jaish-e-Mohammad group claimed responsibility for a bomb attack in Indian-administered Kashmir which killed 40 Indian paramilitary police. 26 Feb 2019 Share this with Facebook Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share this with Email Share this with Facebook Share this with WhatsApp Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share Share this with These are external links and will open in a new window Email Share this with Email Facebook Share this with Facebook Messenger Share this with Messenger Messenger Share this with Messenger Twitter Share this with Twitter Pinterest Share this with Pinterest WhatsApp Share this with WhatsApp LinkedIn Share this with LinkedIn Copy this link https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-asia-47379558/balakot-india-launches-air-strike-in-pakistan Read more about sharing.

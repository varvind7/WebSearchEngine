US President Donald Trump received a mixed reaction of cheers and boos as he took to the field for the national anthem during a college football game in Atlanta. Critics on social media said it looked as though he forgot the lyrics of The Star-Spangled Banner, while his supporters said they were proud to see him stand. The Flag Code makes no mention of whether the anthem should be sung by those present. Singing it is, however, encouraged from school onwards. Tens of thousands of college football fans attended the match between the University of Georgia and the University of Alabama. 09 Jan 2018 Share this with Facebook Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share this with Email Share this with Facebook Share this with WhatsApp Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share Share this with These are external links and will open in a new window Email Share this with Email Facebook Share this with Facebook Messenger Share this with Messenger Messenger Share this with Messenger Twitter Share this with Twitter Pinterest Share this with Pinterest WhatsApp Share this with WhatsApp LinkedIn Share this with LinkedIn Copy this link https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-42616112/did-president-trump-forget-the-words-to-the-national-anthem Read more about sharing.

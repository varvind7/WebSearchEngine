Google generated $18bn (£11.5bn) in revenue from the UK between 2006 and 2011 and paid $16m (£10m) in UK corporate taxes in the same period. Mr Rubin said he welcomed the fact that tax was on the agenda at the G8 summit. Mr Rubin also spoke about Google's decision to donate £3,2m ($5m) to further child protection. He said the money will be used to double the number of analysts "scouring the web for sites that host illegal content". 17 Jun 2013 Share this with Facebook Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share this with Email Share this with Facebook Share this with WhatsApp Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share Share this with These are external links and will open in a new window Email Share this with Email Facebook Share this with Facebook Messenger Share this with Messenger Messenger Share this with Messenger Twitter Share this with Twitter Pinterest Share this with Pinterest WhatsApp Share this with WhatsApp LinkedIn Share this with LinkedIn Copy this link https://www.bbc.com/news/av/technology-22932794/google-we-pay-tax-required-by-law Read more about sharing.

"We had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn't even sink to using chemical weapons," said Mr Spicer while talking about Syria. But critics pointed out the Nazis used gas to kill Jews and others in the Holocaust. Mr Spicer later clarified Hitler didn't use chemical weapons "in the same way" as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. 11 Apr 2017 Share this with Facebook Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share this with Email Share this with Facebook Share this with WhatsApp Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share Share this with These are external links and will open in a new window Email Share this with Email Facebook Share this with Facebook Messenger Share this with Messenger Messenger Share this with Messenger Twitter Share this with Twitter Pinterest Share this with Pinterest WhatsApp Share this with WhatsApp LinkedIn Share this with LinkedIn Copy this link https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-39573063/spicer-hitler-didn-t-even-sink-to-chemical-weapons Read more about sharing.

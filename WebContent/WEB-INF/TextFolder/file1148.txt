The site allowed people to write their names on coke cans but wouldn't allow the word "gay" to be used. It caused a storm on social media, but why was the site (based in South Africa) attracting the attention of the global gay rights movement? And was the criticism fair? Coca Cola sponsor the Sochi Winter Olympics in Russia, and many Olympic sponsors are being criticised by gay rights activists who oppose a Russian law that imposes fines for providing "propaganda" about homosexuality to minors. Coca Cola have now taken down the site and apologised for any offence caused, saying they are "a strong supporter of the LGBT community." Mukul Devichand from #BBCtrending investigates.

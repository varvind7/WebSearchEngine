Protesters at the event in San Francisco on Monday took issue with Ms Pelosi's recent talks with President Trump after he scrapped the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme earlier this month. Ms Pelosi later said that an "agreement" had been reached "to enshrine the protections of Daca into law" in exchange for increased security at the US-Mexico border. 19 Sep 2017 Share this with Facebook Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share this with Email Share this with Facebook Share this with WhatsApp Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share Share this with These are external links and will open in a new window Email Share this with Email Facebook Share this with Facebook Messenger Share this with Messenger Messenger Share this with Messenger Twitter Share this with Twitter Pinterest Share this with Pinterest WhatsApp Share this with WhatsApp LinkedIn Share this with LinkedIn Copy this link https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-41317947/daca-nancy-pelosi-heckled-as-liar-in-dreamers-protest Read more about sharing.

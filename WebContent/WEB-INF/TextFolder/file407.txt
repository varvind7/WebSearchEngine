Last week, #BBCtrending reported on a facebook page called 'gay for a day' - which was set up to show support for gay rights after India's Supreme Court reinstated a ban on same-sex relations. Over the weekend thousands of LGBT supporters demonstrated in cities around the world in protest against the ruling. They used hashtags #globaldayofrage and #nogoingback. Our first video report sparked a huge debate on the BBC World Facebook page. The post attracted more than 1900 comments, both homophobic and pro-LGBT. In this report, #BBCtrending presenter Anne-Marie Tomchak takes a look at the response to the original video. #BBCtrending is a hand-picked selection of stories trending on social media around the world, featured online, on BBC World television and in a weekly World Service radio programme Produced by Benjamin Zand 16 Dec 2013 Share this with Facebook Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share this with Email Share this with Facebook Share this with WhatsApp Share this with Messenger Share this with Twitter Share Share this with These are external links and will open in a new window Email Share this with Email Facebook Share this with Facebook Messenger Share this with Messenger Messenger Share this with Messenger Twitter Share this with Twitter Pinterest Share this with Pinterest WhatsApp Share this with WhatsApp LinkedIn Share this with LinkedIn Copy this link https://www.bbc.com/news/av/magazine-25407222/bbctrending-gay-for-a-day-what-happened-next Read more about sharing.

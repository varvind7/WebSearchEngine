That's the question posed by one man in an Indian village devastated by an ongoing drought in the country. The majority of young men in Gopipur, in the Chitrakoot district about 400 miles south of New Delhi, say that the shortage of water, and its crippling impact on the local economy, has made it harder for them to get married. It's one of the unexpected social consequences of a drought that the Indian government now says is affecting at least 330 million Indians. BBC Pop Up went to the community where nearly 5,000 people rely on a small naturally-fed well for drinking and bathing water.

They are trying to stop the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which would run underneath the Missouri river near the Cheyenne river reservation. It's the biggest gathering of tribes in more than 100 years. The movement is becoming more than a protest. People in the camp say it is a way to reconnect with their identity, pride and heritage after a long history of abuse and segregation.
